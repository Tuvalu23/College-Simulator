   <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Dear {{ name }},</p>
   <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> We have completed our review of the waitlist, and I am sorry to inform you that we are unable to offer you a place in the incoming class for Fall 2025 at the University of Southern California. </p> <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> This decision is driven by space limitations and reflects the extraordinary strength of this year’s applicant and waitlist pools. Our anticipated enrollment of 3,400 students meant that we could only extend offers of admission to a very small number of the talented individuals on our waitlist. </p> <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> Your accomplishments, both academic and personal, are remarkable, and we hope you take pride in all that you have achieved. Please know that this decision is not a judgment of your abilities or potential but rather the result of the highly selective nature of our process. </p> <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> If you remain interested in joining the Trojan Family, we encourage you to consider applying as a transfer student. Many students successfully transfer to USC after demonstrating strong academic performance at another institution. You can find more details about this pathway on our <a href="#" style="color: #0056b3; text-decoration: none;">USC transfer webpage</a>. </p> <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> We deeply appreciate your interest in USC and the time and effort you dedicated to your application. We wish you every success in your academic journey and beyond. </p>
